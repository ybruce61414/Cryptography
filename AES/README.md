# AES-128 Implementation in Pure Python
This is my pure python implementation of ASE 128bit encryption in ECB and CBC modes. For simplicity, we divide it into three sections written as modules and ultimately combine them into one.

1. The encryption key and its expansion
2. Encryption for a single block(128 bits)
3. Decryption for a single block(128 bits)
